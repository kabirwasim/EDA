# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify missing values, and visualize relationships between features to support further machine learning or business decision-making.

## ✅ What This Project Does

- Loads and explores a CSV dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
- Examines dataset structure, size, column types, and missing values.
- Uses visualization libraries to plot:
  - Distribution of values
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Boxplots and histograms

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading**  
   Read CSV data using Pandas with UTF-8 encoding support.

2. **Data Overview**  
   Displayed dataset shape, `.info()` and `.head()` to inspect structure and missing values.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for plotting key insights:
   - Value counts
   - Histograms
   - Correlation matrices

4. **Data Cleaning (if applicable)**  
   - Identified missing or inconsistent values.
   - Checked for duplicate rows.
